This is the homepage for Greek Geeks, where anything to do with Greek mythology can be found. Monsters, gods, and heroes alike are all found here. However, if mythology is not to your liking, you can look at the pages about books inspired/based on/using Greek mythology (like Percy Jackson).

NOTE: if any page does not yet exist, it is probably being worked on.
